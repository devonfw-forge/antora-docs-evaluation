== devonfw Release notes 3.1 “Goku”


==  Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 3.1 (code named “Goku” during development). This version is the first one that implements our new documentation workflow, that will allow users to get the updated documentation at any moment and not to wait for the next devonfw release.

This is now possible as we have established a new workflow and rules during development of our assets. The idea behind this is that all the repositories contain a `documentation` folder and, in any pull request, the developer must include the related documentation change. A new Travis CI configuration added to all these repositories will automatically take the changes and publish them in the wiki section of every repository and in the new devonfw-guide repository that consolidates all the changes from all the repositories. Another pipeline will take changes from this consolidated repository and generate dynamically the devonfw guide in PDF and in the next weeks in HTML for the new planned devonfw website. The following schema explains this process:

This release includes the very first version of the new CobiGen CLI. Now using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Please take a look at https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki/howto_Cobigen-CLI-generation for more info.

The devonfw-shop-floor project has got a lot of updates in order to make even easier the creation of devonfw projects with CICD pipelines that run on the Production Line, deploy on Red Hat OpenShift Clusters and in general Docker environments. See the details below. 

This release includes the very first version of our devonfw-ide tool that will allow users to automate devonfw setup and update the development environment. This tool will become the default devonfw setup tool in future releases. For more information please visit the repository https://github.com/devonfw/devon-ide.

Following the same collaboration model we used in order to improve the integration of devonfw with Red Hat OpenShift and which allowed us to get the Red Hat Open Shift Primed certification, we have been working alongside with SAP HANA developers in order to support this database in the devon4j. This model was based on the contribution and review of pull requests in our reference application My Thai Star. In this case, SAP developers collaborated with us in the following two new use cases:

* Prediction of future demand
* Geospatial analysis and clustering of customers

More info at https://blogs.sap.com/2019/06/17/introducing-devonfw-support-for-sap-hana/.

Last but not least the devonfw extension pack for VS Code has been improved with the latest extensions and helpers for this IDE. Among many others you can now use:

* Remote development on Docker containers and VMs https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack 
* Dependency Analysis for maven and npm https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.fabric8-analytics 
* React Native Tools https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native 
* NgRx Snippets https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=hardikpthv.NgRxSnippets

Also it is worth the try of the updated support for Java and Spring Boot development in VS Code. Check it out for yourself!

== AppSec Quick Solution Guide

This release incorporates a new Solution Guide for Application Security based on the state of the art in OWASP based application security. The purpose of this guide is to offer quick solutions for common application security issues for all applications based on devonfw. It’s often the case that we need our systems to comply to certain sets of security requirements and standards. Each of these requirements needs to be understood, addressed and converted to code or project activity. We want this guide to prevent the wheel from being reinvented over and over again and to give clear hints and solutions to common security problems.

* The PDF can be accessed here: https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-security

== CobiGen

* CobiGen core new features:
** CobiGen CLI: New command line interface for CobiGen. Using commands, you will be able to generate code the same way as you do with Eclipse. This means that you can use CobiGen on other IDEs like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ. Please take a look into the documentation for more info.
*** Performance improves greatly in the CLI thanks to the lack of GUI.
*** You will be able to use path globs for selecting multiple input files.
*** We have implemented a search functionality so that you can easily search for increments or templates.
** First steps taken on CobiGen refactoring: With the new refactoring we will be able to decouple CobiGen completely from the target and input language. This will facilitate the creation of parsers and mergers for any language.
*** NashornJS has been deprecated: It was used for executing JavaScript code inside JVM. With the refactoring, performance has improved on the TypeScript merger.
** Improving CobiGen templates: 
*** Removed Covalent from Angular templates as it is not compatible with Angular 8.
*** Added devon4ng-NgRx templates that implement reactive state management. Note: The TypeScript merger is currently being improved in order to accept NgRx. The current templates are set as overridable by default.
*** Test data builder templates now make use of Lambdas and Consumers.
*** CTOs and ETOs increments have been correctly separated.
** TypeScript merger has been improved: Now it is possible to merge comments (like tsdoc) and enums.
** OpenAPI parsing extended to read enums. Also fixed some bugs when no properties were set or when URLs were too short.
** Java static and object initializers now get merged.
** Fixed bugs when downloading and adapting templates.
