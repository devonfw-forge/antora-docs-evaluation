== devonfw Release notes 2020.04

==  Introduction

We are proud to announce the immediate release of devonfw version 2020.04. This version is the first one with the new versioning that will make easier to the community to identify when it was released since we use the year and month as many other software distributions. 

This release includes lots of bug fixes and many version updates, but it is very important to highlight the following improvements:

* New devonfw IDE auto-configure project feature.
* Improved devonfw IDE plugin configuration.
* New devon4j kafka module.
* New devon4j JWT module.
* New devon4j authorization of batches feature.
* Dozer replaced with Orika in devon4j.  
* Support for composite keys in devon4j and CobiGen.
* Multiple enhancements for project specific plugin development and usage of project specific template sets in CobiGen.
* Ability to adapt your own templates by making use of CobiGen CLI.
* Better responsiveness in eclipse and bugfixes in all assets in CobiGen.
* devon4ng updated to Angular 9, NgRx 9 and Ionic 5, including documentation, samples and templates.
* Yarn 2 support in devon4ng.
* devon4node updated to NestJS 7 (packages, samples and documentation)
* devon4node TSLint replaced with ESLint.
* @devon4node/config package added. 
* devon4net updated to latest .NET Core 3.1.3 LTS version.
* Update of the Production Line templates for devonfw projects in devonfw shop floor. 
* New merge feature included in the devonfw shop floor cicdgen tool.
* Updated sonar-devon4j-plugin:
    ** Improved coloring and other visual cues to our rule descriptions to highlight good and bad code examples.
	** Improved the locations of issues thrown on method- and class-level.

Please check the detailed list below. 

This would have not been possible without the commitment and hard work of the devonfw core team, German, Indian and ADCenter Valencia colleagues and collaborators as, among many others, the Production Line team.
