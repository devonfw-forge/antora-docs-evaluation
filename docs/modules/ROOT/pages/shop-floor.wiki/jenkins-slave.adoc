==  Slaves creation for jenkins

Click on "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Nodes" -> "New Node":
We define a name and select "Permanent Agent"

As we can see in the following image, we need to fill in the fields:

-Name: The slave name

-# of executors: The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this node.
(can be modified later)

-Remote root directory :An agent needs to have a directory dedicated to Jenkins. Specify the path to this directory on the agent.

We have this path in our docker-compose.yml

-Usage:In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.

Launch method: Controls how Jenkins starts this agent.

Once is filled, we click on **'save'** button and we can see our slave created:

If we click in our slave we can see the **'secret'** that we need to add to our docker-compose.yml:

We add it to the docker-compose.yml file:

Once it's done, we go to the command line and write:

``$docker-compose up -d ``
