Install and use custom sonar plugin in Azure Devops
---------------------------------------------------

By default, the sonar plugin is not capable to be used in every branch you want to, to do this you need to purchase a license or customize the current plugin in order to satisfy our needs.

How to costumize the plugin is not the purpose of this documentation, this documentation is for the intallment and use of it.

If you want to install a custom plugin, sign into your Azure Devops organization and once you are in, click on the marketplace icon:

Select *browse marketplace>publish extension

Choose the extension you want to install and clik on the options

*Important*:

You need to choose the organization for which you are going to use the extension and *share it*, if not, you won't be able to install it.

Once you've done this click on View extension and 'Get it free', the extension will be downloaded and you will be able to use it in the next screen

If there are no organizations you can seee the possible causes https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/faq-extensions?view=azure-devops#no-organizations[here].

Another cause might be that you forgot to share the extension.

Note: If the install button does not appear, it's possible that you don't have permissions to install it so you will need to talk with the owner of the org.
Another posibility is that you can _request_ an installation.

Once installed, in the pipeline wizard it will appear and you will be able to select it.

We can see in the image the default plugin and the customized one.
