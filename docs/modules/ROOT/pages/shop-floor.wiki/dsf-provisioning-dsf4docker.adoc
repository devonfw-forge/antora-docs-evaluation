==  Prerequisite

To use dsf4docker provisioning environment you need a remote server and you must clone or download devonfw shop floor.

==  How to use it

Navigate to `./devonfw-shop-floor/dsf4docker/environment` and here you can find one scripts to install it, and another one to uninstall it.

== Install devonfw shop floor 4 Docker

There is an installation script to do so, so the complete installation should be completed by running it. Make sure this script has execution permissions in the Docker Host:

[source,bash]
----
 chmod +x dsf4docker-install.sh
 sudo ./dsf4docker-install.sh
----


This script, besides the container "installation" itself, will also adapt the `docker-compose.yml` file to your host (using `sed` to replace the **IP_ADDRESS** word of the file for your real Docker Host's IP address).

== Uninstall devonfw shop floor 4 Docker

As well as for the installation, if we want to remove everything concerning **devonfw shop floor 4 Docker** from our Docker Host, we'll run this script:

[source,bash]
----
 chmod +x dsf4docker-uninstall.sh
 sudo ./dsf4docker-uninstall.sh
----

==  Troubleshooting

When trying to execute the install or uninstall .sh there may be some problems related to the windows/linux format file, so if you see this error log while executing the script:
----
./dsf4docker-install.sh: line 16: $'\r': command not found
----
You need to do a file conversion with this command:
----
dos2unix dsf4docker-install.sh 
----
or 
----
dos2unix dsf4docker-uninstall.sh
----
==  A little history

The *Docker* part of the shop floor is created based on the experience of the environment setup of the project *Mirabaud Advisory*, and intended to be updated to latest versions. Mirabaud Advisory is a web service developed with devonfw (Java) that, alongside its own implementation, it needed an environment both for the team to follow CICD rules through their 1-week-long sprints and for the client (Mirabaud) to check the already done work.

There is a practical experience about the link:dsf-mirabaud-cicd-environment-setup.adoc[Mirabaud Case].
