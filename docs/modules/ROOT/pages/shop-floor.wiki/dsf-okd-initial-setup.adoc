==  Known issues

== Failed to push image

If you receive an error like this:
```
error: build error: Failed to push image: After retrying 6 times, Push image still failed due to error: Get http://172.30.1.1:5000/v2/:  dial tcp 172.30.1.1:5000: getsockopt: connection refused
```

It's because the registry isn't working, go to openshift console and enter into the *default* project ```https://x.x.x.x:8443/console/project/default/overview``` and you must see two resources, *docker-registry* and *router* they must be running. If they don't work, try to deploy them and look at the logs what is happen.
