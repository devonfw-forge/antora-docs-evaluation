== Customize Openshift Origin for devonfw

This is a guide to customize Openshift cluster.

==  Images Styles

The icons for templates must measure the same as below or the images don't show right:

* `Openshift logo`: 230px x 40px.
* `Template logo`: 50px x 50px.
* `Category logo`: 110px x 36px.

==  How to use

To use it, we need to enter in openshift as an admin and use the next command:

[source,Shell]
----
$ oc login

$ oc edit configmap/webconsole-config -n openshift-web-console
----

After this, we can see in our shell the webconsole-config.yaml, we only need to navigate until *extensions* and add the url for our own `css` in the *stylesheetURLs* and `javascript` in the *scriptURLs* section.

*IMPORTANT: Scripts and stylesheets must be served with the correct content type or they will not be run by the browser. Scripts must be served with Content-Type: application/javascript and stylesheets with Content-Type: text/css.*

In git repositories, the content type of raw is text/plain. You can use https://rawgit.com/[rawgit] to convert a raw from a git repository to the correct content type.

Example:

[source,YAML]
----
webconsole-config.yaml: |
  [...]
    extensions:
      scriptURLs:
        - https://cdn.rawgit.com/devonfw/devonfw-shop-floor/master/dsf4openshift/openshift-cluster-setup/initial-setup/customizeOpenshift/scripts/catalog-categories.js
      stylesheetURLs:
        - https://cdn.rawgit.com/devonfw/devonfw-shop-floor/master/dsf4openshift/openshift-cluster-setup/initial-setup/customizeOpenshift/stylesheet/icons.css
