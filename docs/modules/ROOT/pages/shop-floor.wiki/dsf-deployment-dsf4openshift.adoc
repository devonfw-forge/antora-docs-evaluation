== dsf4openshift deployment environment

In this section you will see how you can create a new environment instance in OpenShift and the things that you must add to the Jenkinsfiles of your repository to deploy a branch in this new environment. To conclude you are going to see how to add config files for environment in the source code of the applications.

==  Configure your OpenShift to deploy your devonfw projects

== Prerequisites

== ==  OpenShift Cluster

To have your deployment environment with OpenShift you need to have an OpenShift Cluster.

// TODO: For example, you can obtain it from ITAAS

== Manual configuration

Here you can find all that you need to know to link:dsf-deployment-dsf4openshift-manual-configuration.adoc[configure OpenShift] manually.

== Automatic configuration

Here you can find all that you need to know to link:dsf-deployment-dsf4openshift-automatic-configuration.adoc[configure OpenShift] automatically.

==  Service integration with jenkins

== Prerequisites

To integrate it, you need to have installed the plugin OpenShift Client. To install it go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Manage Plugins_*. Go to Available tab and search it using the filter textbox in the top right corner and install it.

== Configuration

Second, you need to configure the OC Client. Go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Global Tool Configuration_*.

Go to OpenShift Client Tools section and add a new one like this.

==  Upgrade your Jenkinsfile

Now it is time to add/upgrade the next stages in to your Jenkinsfile:

Add link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile#create-docker-image.adoc[create docker image] stage.

Add link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile#deploy-docker-image.adoc[deploy docker image] stage.

Add link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile#check-status.adoc[check status] stage.

Upgrade link:dsf-configure-jenkinsfile#setup-Jenkins-tools.adoc[Setup Jenkins tools] stage.

NOTE: Remember to upgrade your parameters to difference which environment is used per branch.
