== SonarQube Configuration

To use SonarQube you need to use a *token* to connect, and to know the results of the analysis you need a *webhook*. Also, you need to install and configure SonarQube in Jenkins.

==  Generate user token

To generate the user token, go to your account clicking in the left icon on the top menu bar.

NOTE: If you don't have any account, you can use the admin/admin user/pass

Go to security tab and generate the token.

==  Webhook

When you execute our SonarQube scanner in our pipeline job, you need to ask SonarQube if the quality gate has been passed. To do it you need to create a webhook.

Go to administration clicking the option on the top bar menu and select the tab for Configuration.

Then search in the left menu to go to webhook section and create your webhook.

An example for Production Line:

==  Jenkins integration

To use SonarQube in our pipelines you need to configure Jenkins to integrate SonarQube.

== SonarQube Scanner

First, you need to configure the scanner. Go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Global Tool Configuration_*.

Go to SonarQube Scanner section and add a new SonarQube scanner like this.

== SonarQube Server

Now you need to configure where is our SonarQube server using the user token that you create before. Go to Manage Jenkins clicking on left menu and enter in *_Configure System_*.

For example, in Production Line the server is the next:

NOTE: Remember, the token was created at the beginning  of this SonarQube configuration.

==  SonarQube configuration

Now is time to configure your sonar in order to measure the quality of your code. To do it, please follow the official documentation about our plugins and Quality Gates and Profiles https://github.com/devonfw/sonar-devon4j-plugin[here].

== How to ignore files

Usually the developers need to ignore some files from Sonar analysis. To do that, they must add the next line as a parameter of the sonar execution to their Jenkinsfile in the SonarQube code analysis step.
