== Introduction to project management in the dashboard

- The *dashboard* manages multiple projects in multiple workspaces that include Angular, JAVA, and Node. +

- The *dashboard* provides rich UI for creating multiple projects, abstracting all the functionality which is usually required while creating an application like opening a command terminal, specifying workspace, and executing commands. +

- The *dashboard* makes it easy to see all the projects which are in different devonfw-ide workspace, just by changing the "devonfw Instance" dropdown. 

- The *dashboard* makes it very easy to open a project in a different IDE like Visual Studio or Eclipse respectively just by right click on the Project folder and open option.

- The *dashboard* also makes it easy to delete the project, explore the project location. +

== Projects

Click on the *Projects* link on the sidebar to navigate to the project's screen. The screen displays all the projects in the currently selected devonfw-ide, grouped by the workspaces in which they exist. +
Note: Currently it only displays projects created through the dashboard. +

- It shows the total number of projects available in each *devonfw-ide*.

- Filtering and searching the projects.

- *Add New Project* - For creating a Project.

- Project folder which gives information about the project like which technology the project belongs to, the name of the project, and when it has created. 

- There are many operations that are available on right-click on *Project folder* they are : 

. Opening a project in different IDE ( Visual Studio or Eclipse )

. Enclosing Folder, and

. Deleting the project.

- Users can see projects of different *devonfw-ide* workspace just by changing the option in the *devonfw instance* dropdown which is set globally at the top of the screen.

Click on *Add New Project* to start creating a new project. +

== How to create a project

Three main steps are involved in creating any devonfw project. They are: +

*Step 1. Project Type* +

In this first step the user has to choose the language technology to start the project with, e.g. *Angular*, *Java* or *Node* and click the *Next* button for to continue to the next step.

*Step 2. Project Data* +

After the *Project type* selection, the second screen will appear for the user to fill up all the required fields. User can select the workspace in the active devonfw-ide for the project in this step. Once the user enters all the required fields, the *Next* button will be enabled for the final step. +

User can change the *devonfw-ide* workspace where the project is going to generate, just by changing the option in the *devonfw instance* dropdown which is set globally in the header of the dashboard. +

*Step 3. Execution* +

The execution step takes all the user entered data from the *Project Data* step and executes the respective commands to generate the project. +

*Execution* has divided into two sections: +
- Creation +
- Setup Installation

==== 3.1 Creation

* Creates only source code and notify the user if the project creation fails or success.
