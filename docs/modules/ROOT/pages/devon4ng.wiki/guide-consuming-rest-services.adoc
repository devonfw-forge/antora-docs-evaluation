== Consuming REST services

A good introduction to working with `Angular HttpClient` can be found in https://angular.io/guide/http[Angular Docs]

This guide will cover, how to embed `Angular HttpClient` in the application architecture.
For back-end request a special service with the suffix `Adapter` needs to be defined.

==  Defining Adapters

It is a good practice to have a Angular service whose single responsibility is to call the back-end and parse the received value to a transfer data model (e.g. Swagger generated TOs).
Those services need to have the suffix `Adapter` to make them easy to recognize.

.Adapters handle back-end communication
image::images/rest-adapter.svg["Adapters handle back-end communication", width="450", link="images/rest-adapter.svg"]

As illustrated in the figure a Use Case service does not use `Angular HttpClient` directly but uses an adapter.
A basic adapter could look like this:

[source,ts]
.Example adapter
----
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';

import { FlightTo } from './flight-to';

@Injectable({
 providedIn: 'root',
})
export class FlightsAdapter {

  constructor(
    private httpClient: HttpClient
  ) {}

  getFlights(): Observable<FlightTo> {
    return this.httpClient.get<FlightTo>('/relative/url/to/flights');
  }

}
----

The adapters should use a well-defined transfer data model.
This could be generated from server endpoints with CobiGen, Swagger, typescript-maven-plugin, etc.
If inside the application there is a business model defined, the adapter has to parse to the transfer model.
This is illustrated in the following listing.

[source,ts]
.Example adapter mapping from business model to transfer model
----
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

import { FlightTo } from './flight-to';
import { Flight } from '../../../model/flight';

@Injectable({
 providedIn: 'root',
})
export class FlightsAdapter {

  constructor(
    private httpClient: HttpClient
  ) {}

  updateFlight(flight: Flight): Observable<Flight> {
    const to = this.mapFlight(flight);

    return this.httpClient.post<FlightTo>('/relative/url/to/flights', to).pipe(
      map(to => this.mapFlightTo(to))
    );
  }

  private mapFlight(flight: Flight): FlightTo {
    // mapping logic
  }

  private mapFlightTo(flightTo: FlightTo): Flight {
    // mapping logic
  }

}
----

==  Token management

In most cases the access to back-end API is secured using well known mechanisms as **CSRF**, **JWT** or both. In these cases the front-end application must manage the tokens that are generated when the user authenticates. More concretely it must store them to include them in every request automatically. Obviously, when user logs out these tokens must be removed from `localStorage`, memory, etc.

== Store security token

In order to make this guide simple we are going to store the token in memory. Therefore, if we consider that we already have a login mechanism implemented we would like to store the token using a `auth.service.ts`:

[source, typescript]
----
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class AuthService {
  private loggedIn = false;
  private token: string;

  constructor(public router: Router) {}

  public isLogged(): boolean {
    return this.loggedIn || false;
  }

  public setLogged(login: boolean): void {
    this.loggedIn = login;
  }

  public getToken(): string {
    return this.token;
  }

  public setToken(token: string): void {
    this.token = token;
  }
}
----

Using the previous service we will be able to store the token obtained in the login request using the method `setToken(token)`. Please consider that, if you want a more sophisticated approach using `localStorage` API, you will need to modify this service accordingly.

== Include token in every request

Now that the token is available in the application it is necessary to include it in every request to a protected API endpoint. Instead of modifying all the HTTP requests in our application, Angular provides a class to intercept every request (and every response if we need to) called `HttpInterceptor`. Let's create a service called `http-interceptor.service.ts` to implement the `intercept` method of this class:

[source, typescript]
----
import {
  HttpEvent,
  HttpHandler,
  HttpInterceptor,
  HttpRequest,
} from '@angular/common/http';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { environment } from '../../../environments/environment';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class HttpRequestInterceptorService implements HttpInterceptor {
  
  constructor(private auth: AuthService) {}

  intercept(
    req: HttpRequest<any>,
    next: HttpHandler,
  ): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    // Get the auth header from the service.
    const authHeader: string = this.auth.getToken();
    if (authHeader) {
      let authReq: HttpRequest<any>;

      // CSRF
      if (environment.security == 'csrf') {
        authReq = req.clone({
          withCredentials: true,
          setHeaders: { 'x-csrf-token': authHeader },
        });
      }

      // JWT
      if (environment.security == 'jwt') {
        authReq = req.clone({
          setHeaders: { Authorization: authHeader },
        });
      }

      return next.handle(authReq);
    } else {
      return next.handle(req);
    }
  }
}
----

As you may notice, this service is making use of an environment field `environment.security` to determine if we are using JWT or CSRF in order to inject the token accordingly. In your application you can combine both if necessary.

Configure environment.ts file to use the CSRF/JWT.

[source]
----
security: 'csrf'
----

The `authHeader` used is obtained using the injected service `AuthService` already presented above.

In order to activate the interceptor we need to provide it in our `app.module.ts` or `core.module.ts` depending on the application structure. Let's assume that we are using the latter and the interceptor file is inside a `security` folder:

[source, typescript]
----
...
import { HttpRequestInterceptorService } from './security/http-request-interceptor.service';
...

@NgModule({
  imports: [...],
  exports: [...],
  declarations: [],
  providers: [
    ...
    {
      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
      useClass: HttpRequestInterceptorService,
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
})
export class CoreModule {}
----

Angular automatically will now modify every request and include in the header the token if it is convenient.
