== Yarn 2

Yarn v2 is a very different software from the v1. The following list contains the main new features:

- https://yarnpkg.com/features/constraints[Constraints]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/offline-cache[Offline Cache]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp[Plug'n'Play]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/plugins[Plugins]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/protocols[Protocols]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/release-workflow[Release Workflow]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces[Workspaces]
- https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs[Zero-Installs]

Please, read them carefully to decide if your current project is suitable to use Yarn 2 as package manager.

IMPORTANT: Some features are still experimental, so please do not use them in production environments.

More info at https://yarnpkg.com/ 

==  Global Install

Installing Yarn 2.x globally is discouraged as Yarn team is moving to a per-project install strategy. We advise you to keep Yarn 1.x (Classic) as your global binary by installing it via the instructions you can find https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install[here].

Once you've followed the instructions (running yarn --version from your home directory should yield something like 1.22.0), go to the next section to see how to enable Yarn 2 on your project.

==  Per-project install

Follow these instructions to update your current devon4ng project to Yarn 2: 

. Follow the global install instructions.
. Move into your project folder:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/path/to/project
----

. Run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
yarn policies set-version berry # below v1.22
yarn set version berry          # on v1.22+
----

. Since Angular CLI still is not fully supported with the new https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/architecture[Yarn architecture] as it is not compatible with PnP it is necessary to include the https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/tree/master/packages/plugin-nm[`node-modules`] plugin adding the following line in the `.yarnrc.yml` file:
+
[source,yml]
----
nodeLinker: node-modules
----
. Commit the `.yarn` and `.yarnrc.yml` changes
. Run again `yarn install`.

NOTE: For more advanced migration topics please refer to https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/migration 

==  Which files should be added to gitignore file?
If you're using Zero-Installs:

[source, gitignore]
----
.yarn/*
!.yarn/cache
!.yarn/releases
!.yarn/plugins
----

If you're not using Zero-Installs:
