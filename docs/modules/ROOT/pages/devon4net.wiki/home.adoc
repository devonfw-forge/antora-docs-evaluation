== devon4net

This guide describes an application architecture for API development with https://dotnet.microsoft.com/[.net core].

==  Motivation

The main challenge we encounter in our projects is to bring junior and senior developers into .net core.
There are a lot of different frameworks and architectures in the market.
The idea is to define an architecture which is a compromise between, on the one hand, leveraging the best practices and latest trends.
On the other hand, providing a short onboarding time while still using an architecture that helps us scale and be productive at the same time.
Also, the architecture must be compatible with the market. 
Guides, practices and naming found in the web should still be valid (e.g. a stackoverflow article for a given problem).
