== GraphQL on Devon4Node

GraphQL is a query language that gets exactly the data that we ask for instead of static predefined responses.

For example, on a regular API a get by id method would return something like:

[source, json]
----
{
  "location": {
    "lon": 00.14,
    "lat": 54.11
  },
  "station": "dsrEE3Sg",
  "visibility": 5000,
  "wind":{
    "speed": 6.2,
    "deg": 78
  },
  "logs": [...]
  ...
}
----
But if we want to get *only* the wind data we have to create another endpoint that returns the specified data.

But instead with graphQL we can get different information without creating new endpoints, in this case we only want the wind data so it would return:

[source, json]
----
{
  "wind":{
    "speed": 6.2,
    "deg": 78
  }
}
----

To install it:

[source,bash]
----
yarn add @nestjs/graphql graphql-tools graphql apollo-server-express

==  Schema first

[NOTE]
== == 
This tutorial uses the schema first method.

We assume you have already a functioning TODO module / app.

If not you can use https://github.com/devonfw/devon4node/tree/develop/samples/graphql[Devon4node GraphQL sample]
== == 

First we need to import GraphQLModule to our `app.module.ts`.

[source,typescript]
----
...
import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { join } from 'path';

@Module({
  imports: [
    // Your module import
    GraphQLModule.forRoot({
      typePaths: ['./**/*.graphql'],
      definitions: {
        path: join(process.cwd(), 'src/graphql.ts'),
        outputAs: 'class',
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
----

The `typePaths` indicates the location of the schema definition files.

The `definitions` indicates the file where the typescript definitions will automatically save, adding the `outputAs: 'class'` saves those definitions as classes.

== Schema

Graphql is a typed language with `object types`, `scalars`, and `enums`.

We use `query` to define the methods we are going to use for fetching data, and `mutations` are used for modifying this data, similar to how `GET` and `POST` work.

Let's define the elements, queries and mutations that our module is going to have.

For that we have to create a graphql file on our module, on this case we are going to name it "schema.graphql".

[source,typescript]
----
type Todo {
  id: ID
  task: String
}

type Query {
  todos: [Todo]
  todoById: Todo
}

type Mutation {
  createTodo(task: String): Todo
  deleteTodo(id: String): Todo
}
----

For more information about Types go to the official https://graphql.org/learn/schema/[graphQL documentation]


== Resolver

Resolver has the instructions to turn GraphQL orders into the data requested.

To create a resolver we go to our module and then create a new `todo.resolver.ts` file, import the decorators needed and set the resolver.

[source,typescript]
----
import { Resolver, Args, Mutation, Query } from '@nestjs/graphql';
import { TodoService } from '../services/todo.service';
import { Todo } from '../schemas/todo.schema';

@Resolver()
export class TodoResolver {
  constructor(private readonly todoService: TodoService) {}

  @Query('todos')
  findAll(): Promise<Todo[]> {
    return this.todoService.findAll();
  }

  @Query('todoById')
  findOneById(@Args('id') id: string): Promise<Todo | null> {
    return this.todoService.findOneById(id);
  }

  @Mutation()
  createTodo(@Args('task') task: string): Promise<Todo> {
    return this.todoService.create(task);
  }

  @Mutation()
  deleteTodo(@Args('id') id: string): Promise<Todo | null> {
    return this.todoService.delete(id);
  }
}
----

`@Resolver()` indicates that the next class is a resolver.

`@Query` is used to get data.

`@Mutation` is used to create or modify data.

Here we have also an argument decorator `@Args` which is an object with the arguments passed into the field in the query.

By default we can access the query or mutation using the method's name, for example:

For the `deleteTodo` mutation.

[source,typescript]
----
mutation {
  deleteTodo( id: "6f7ed2q8" ){
    id,
    task
  }
}
----

But if we write something different on the decorator, we change the name, for example:

For the `findAll` query, we named it `todos`.
[source,typescript]
----
{
  todos{
    id,
    task
  }
}
----
Also if we go back to the `schema.graphql`, we will see how we define the query with `todos`.

Learn more about Resolvers, mutations and their argument decorators on the https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/resolvers#schema-first[NestJS documentation].


== Playground

To test our backend we can use tools as Postman, but graphql already gives us a playground to test our Resolvers, we can access by default on `http://localhost:3000/graphql`. 

We can call a query, or several queries this way:

[source,typescript]
----
{
  findAll{
    id,
    task
  }
}
----

And the output will look something like:
[source,typescript]
----
{
  "data": {
    "findAll": [
      {
        "id": "5fb54b30e686cb49500b6728",
        "task": "clean dishes"
      },
      {
        "id": "5fb54b3be686cb49500b672a",
        "task": "burn house"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

As we can see, we get a json "data" with an array of results.

And for our mutations it's very similar, in this case we create a todo with task "rebuild house" and we are going to ask on the response just for the task data, we don't want the id.

[source,typescript]
----
mutation{
  createTodo (
    task: "rebuild house"
  ){
    task
  }
}
----

And the output 

[source,json]
----
{
  "data": {
    "createTodo": {
      "task": "rebuild house"
    }
  }
}
----

In this case we return just one item so there is no array, we also got just the `task data` but if we want the `id` too, we just have to add it on the request.

To make the playground unavailable we can add an option to the app.module import:

[source,typescript]
----
...
GraphQLModule.forRoot({
  ...
  playground: false,
}),
...
----
