== What is devonfw?

image::images/introduction/devonfw-small.png[,align="center",width="250",devonfw, link="https://devonfw.com/"]

Welcome to the *devonfw* platform. This is a product of the CSD (Custom Solution Development) industrialization effort to establish a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements, in which clients don't specify the use of a predefined technology stack. In these cases we can offer a proven alternative as a result of our experience as a group.

devonfw is a development platform aiming for the standardization of processes and the boosting of productivity. It provides an architecture blueprint for server and client applications, alongside a set of tools to deliver a fully functional, _out-of-the-box_ development environment.

TIP: The devonfw _name_ is a registered trademark of image:images/introduction/Capgemini_Logo_Small.png[,width="80",Capgemini,link="https://www.capgemini.com/"], but the software and documentation included in _devonfw_ are fully open source. Please refer to our https://github.com/devonfw/devonfw-guide/blob/master/general/oss-compliance.adoc[OSS Compliance] section for more information.

==  Building Blocks of the Platform

_devonfw_ uses a state-of-the-art, open source, core reference architecture for the server (these days considered a commodity in the IT-industry) and on top of that an ever increasing number of high-value assets, which are developed by Capgemini.

==  The devonfw Technology Stack
devonfw is fully open source and consists of the following technology stacks:

== Back-End Solutions
For server applications, _devonfw_ includes the following solutions:

* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j[devon4j]: Server implementation based on Java, https://spring.io/[Spring] and https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot].
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4net[devon4net]: Server implementation based on https://dotnet.microsoft.com/[.NET].
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4node[devon4node]: Server implementation based on https://nestjs.com/[NestJS].

== Front-End solutions
For client applications, _devonfw_ includes two solutions based on _TypeScript_, _JavaScript_, _C#_ and _.NET_:

* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng[devon4ng]: Frontend implementation based on https://angular.io/[Angular] and a hybrid mobile implementation based on https://ionicframework.com/[Ionic].
* https://github.com/devonfw/devon4x[devon4X]: Mobile implementation based on https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/[Xamarin].

==  Custom Tools

== devonfw-ide
The https://github.com/devonfw/ide/wiki#devonfw-ide[devonfw-ide] is _not_ one monolithic program that is installed with a traditional executable; rather it's a collection of scripts which are invoked via command line to automate several, repetetive development tasks. These scripts then interact with other tools, frameworks, and third-party IDEs to streamline the development workflow.

The advantage of this approach is, that you can have as many instances of the _devonfw-ide_ on your machine as you need -- for different projects with different tools, tool versions and configurations. No need for a physical installation and no tweaking of your operating system required!

Instances of the devonfw-ide do not interfere with each other, nor with other installed software. The package size of the _devonfw-ide_ is initally very small, the setup is simple, and the included software is portable.

== ==  IDEs
It supports the following IDEs:

* https://www.eclipse.org/ide/[Eclipse]
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code]
* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]

== ==  Platforms
It supports the following platforms:

* https://go.java/index.html[Java] (see also https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki[devon4j])
* https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] (see also https://github.com/devonfw/devon4node/wiki/[devon4node])
* https://angular.io/[Angular] (see also https://github.com/devonfw/devon4ng/wiki[devon4ng])
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/[C#] (see also https://github.com/devonfw/devon4net/wiki[devon4net])

== ==  Build-Systems
It supports the following build-systems:

* https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]
* https://www.npmjs.com/[NPM]
* https://gradle.org/[Gradle]

TIP: Other IDEs, platforms, or tools can easily be integrated as https://github.com/devonfw/ide/wiki/cli#commandlets[commandlets].

== CobiGen

https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen/wiki#architecture[CobiGen] is a code generator included in the _devonfw-ide_, that allows users to generate the project structure and large parts of the application component code. This saves a lot of time, which is usually wasted on repetitive engineering tasks and/or writing boilerplate code.

image::images/introduction/cobigen.png[,width="550", link="images/introduction/cobigen.png"]

Following the same philosophy as the devonfw-ide, _CobiGen_ bundles a new command line interface (CLI), that enables the generation of code using only a few commands. This approach also allows us to decouple CobiGen from _Eclipse_ and use it alongside _VS Code_ or _IntelliJ IDEA_.
