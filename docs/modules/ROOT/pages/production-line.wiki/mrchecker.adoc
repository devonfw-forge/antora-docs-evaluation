==  Summary

Using this documentation you should be able to run MrChercker test framework on ProductionLine. +
MrChecker offers two projects to your disposal: +

* First project "mrchecker-app-under-test/pipelines/CI/Jenkinsfile_ProductionLine.groovy" has all tests included in the project and is the default project used in "MrChecker_Example_Tests" job. +
* Second project "mrchecker-app-under-testboilerplate/pipelines/CI/Jenkinsfile_ProductionLine.groovy" here tests are not included, therefore if you choose to run "MrChecker_Example_Tests" job Allure report will be not generated. +

To change the project change script path at the bottom of the "MrChecker_Example_Tests" job.
