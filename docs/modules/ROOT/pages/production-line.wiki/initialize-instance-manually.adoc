== Initialize Instance Template for Production Line

==  Technical User Setup 

In order to configure the services, we need technical users for the following components:

* Gitlab
* Nexus3
* SonarQube

*The following sections describe how to configure the components to enable technical users and tokens.*

== Technical Gitlab User and settings

The creation of the GitLab Group and Project will require a private GitLab token which has to be created manually. The token can be obtained like this:


1. Go to your Profile in Gitlab

== == 
The GitLab API user needs to have API access and the rights to create a new group. To set this permission follow the next steps:
== == 

1. Enter the Admin control panel
2. Select 'Users'
3. Select the user(s) in question and click 'Edit'
4. Scroll down to 'Access' and un-tick 'Can Create Group'


== Technical Nexus3 user and settings

Nexus3 is used to store build artifacts such as the frontend and the backend. In the future it might also be used to store docker images of MTS.

== ==  Create the technical Nexus User

1. The nexus3-api user should be created in section Administration

== ==   Add it as credential in Jenkins

Credentials 'nexus-api' user should be added to Jenkins
Jenkins -> Credentials -> System -> Global credentials (unrestricted) -> Add Credentials

== ==  Sonarqube Server configuration in Jenkins

SonarQube must be configured in Jenkins, so that we can easily use the SonarQube server in our builds.

Go to Jenkins -> Settings -> Configuration -> SonarQube Servers

Add the following data

== Technical SonarQube user and settings

== ==  User Token for SonarQube

* Go to SonarQube.
* Go to your account.

* Go to Security tab.
* Generate the token.

== ==  Install SonarQube plugins from Marketplace

In order to analyze devonfw projects in SonarQube properly, you need to install manually some plugins. To do that you only need to open your SonarQube website and go to Administration -> Marketplace. Then, you need to install the following plugins:

- Checkstyle
- Cobertura

== ==  SonarQube Webhook to inform Jenkins

A part of the Build Job will ask SonarQube if the quality gate has been passed. For this step a so called "webhook" has to be configured in SonarQube. To do so,

. Go to SonarQube
. Select 'Administration'
. Select 'Configuration', 'General Settings' and select 'Webhooks' in the left menu
. Add the following webhook
