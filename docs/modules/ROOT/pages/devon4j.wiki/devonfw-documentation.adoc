==devonfw Documentation 
We are using the github adoc feature to create and maintain the documentation for devonfw. Also the documentation PDFs are generated from these adoc files.

The source of the documentation is always located in the `documentation` folder of the main git repository (see `Code` tab and then click on `documentation`). These files are automatically synchronized to the wiki. This is for pure usability reasons as people typically go to the `Wiki` tab on github repositories to look for documentation. However, the wiki is a read-only copy of the `documentation` folder from the `Code` repo.

== Contribution to devon4j documentation
Contributions and improvements to the documentation are welcome. However, you should be aware of the following aspects:

* Your contributions will become part of the devon4j documentation and is licensed under creative commons (see footer).
* If you want to contribute larger changes (beyond fixing a typo or a link) please consider to get in contact with the community (by creating an https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/issues[issue]) before getting started. You do not want to write complete chapters and then get your work rejected afterwards.
* Please consult the https://github.com/devonfw/devon-docgen/wiki#guidelines[DocGen manual] as we are using DocGen
to generate the documentation starting from link:devon4j-doc[].

If you consider all the aspects above you can start editing the documentation if you have a https://github.com/join[github-account]. For small and simple changes just go to the adoc file in the `documentation` folder. Then click on the pencil-icon (you have to be signed in). Now github will allow you to edit the raw adoc text. Do your changes and preview them (using the `Preview` tab). Once complete, commit the changes as a new branch. From there click on `compare and pull-request` and finally confirm your pull-request.
For larger changes, you should create a fork just as for link:devonfw-code-contribution[code-contributions]. Often larger changes imply changes to documentation and code.
